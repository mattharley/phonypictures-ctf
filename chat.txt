Hero: How's your day going?
 
Shy: Ugh. Can't stand Nerdy and his stupid Cryptophone 500
 
Hero: Hahah. Pretty sure he uses the same password across everything. It's probably something simple like "letmein"
 
Shy: That wouldn't surprise me, the guy thinks he is all secure and sh*t...did you see what he last bought on Amazone?!
 
Hero: WTF!!  Is he still on that crazy shopping portal for Adult Diapers and Fleshlights!?
 
Shy: Oh yes...he LOVES that stuff more than self-signed certificates!
 
Hero: That is like totally awesome!  So...how is that new role working out for you?
 
Shy: Man...the new boss is a total hag...always brushing up close and being suggestive...it's like working at a health spa in Rockingham!
 
Hero: Wow (*pants)
 
Shy: He is really winding me up about the new Game of Clones movie too....I am sure he has a copy on the internal server!  (*pouts)
 
Hero: LOL GTG CU L8R Bye!
